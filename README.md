# Alert Handler Test

This is repo for testing alert handler component of the website

We can start from start.sh to configure virtual environment and dependency we need to do test of alert handler.

We need to change start.sh file as executable file in bash command terminal with this command:
```
sudo chmod +x start.sh
```
We can start using start.sh by using command :
```
./start.sh
```

So we can start to use alert handler in main.py file with command :
```
python3 main.py
```
